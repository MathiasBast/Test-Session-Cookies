# Test-Session-Cookies
Just testing how session id works and stuff

**Start By -**  
"npm install"   
"npm run dev"

This does use express-session to log in and out 

It does this by adding a userId property to the cookie when you log in and removes it when you log out. 

The id is under session.userID or req.session.userID
